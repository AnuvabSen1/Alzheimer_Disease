## Introduction

Our Biomedical Imaging VIT Model represents a breakthrough in the field of biomedical image analysis. It incorporates complex concepts such as:

- **Vision Transformer (VIT):** A transformer-based neural network architecture that has shown remarkable performance in various computer vision tasks.

- **Self-Attention Mechanisms:** These mechanisms allow the model to weigh the importance of different image regions adaptively, enabling fine-grained feature extraction.

- **Biomedical Imaging:** Our model is tailored for analyzing medical images, including but not limited to X-rays, MRIs, and histopathological slides.
